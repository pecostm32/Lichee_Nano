The projects here have a lot in common with the ones in the FNIRSI repositories. 
The Lichee Nano is used to test the new FPGA programming being developed for the FNIRSI-1013D.
This development is a combined effort of morris6 (EEVBlog name) and me. It is for learning purposes and fun. No garanty it will ever work.
